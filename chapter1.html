                    <p>
                        What is your most prevalent thought, and why?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What if we replaced that thought with the word 'breathe'?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Language is meant to convey the truth; truth that is not subject to change
                        but truth that is eternally the same.
                        <br>
                        Among all my thoughts, which of them are more true than my breathe?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So we practice returning to to the truth, over and over again, looking forward to the
                        moment when we no longer have to try so hard, in a world that can't stop pulling us
                        away from truth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Why?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Because we are too prideful to accept that life can be so simple.
                        <br>
                        "Breathe... that's it?"
                        <br>
                        We long for more, yet in our quest to build ourselves up so that we may be praised by
                        others, we end up settling for less.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Friends, as we look forward to the moment when we no longer have to try so hard, we may
                        also acknowledge that that moment has already come.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now, we can breathe.
                    </p>
